    <p><cite>The Bachelor of Technology (BTech) is a four-year undergraduate degree that focuses on practical and theoretical knowledge in technology and engineering fields. It is offered by various institutions, including Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), and other recognized institutes. The BTech program covers a wide range of engineering disciplines, such as Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and more.
Admission to BTech programs is typically based on entrance exams like JEE Main, JEE Advanced, VITEEE, and others. The curriculum includes core engineering subjects along with specialization-specific courses. Graduates can pursue various career paths in engineering, technology, and related fields, with opportunities for further studies in higher education or higher specializations. </cite></p>
